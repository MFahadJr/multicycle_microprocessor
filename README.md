# multicycle_microprocessor

Hardware design of a multicycle microprocessor developed in VHDL, and demonstrated using FPGA Artix 7 (Xilinx).
Test in two applications:
  - Given two number using switches get Greatest Common Divisor (GCD). The result visualized on the display.
  - Given a vector of numbers, calculate the maximum number in the vector.
